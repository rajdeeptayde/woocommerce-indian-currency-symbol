woocommerce-indian-currency-symbol
This plugin provides the webrupee font for indian currency symbol in woocommerce, I have faced a problem whenever I work on any wordpress and woocommerce related stores when we use Indian currency it does not show up to users on store so this is the solution for that just install this plugin and check the store.
